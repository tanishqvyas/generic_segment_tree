# Generic Segment Trees
A generic implementation of **Segment Trees** using C++.

Using this library one can easily use segment trees in code 
and can perform all sorts of operation according to one's use
case. 

User's are expected to create a functor according to thier use case
and pass that as a parameters to respective functions. However, we
have already implemented most commonly used functor's like Add , sub
mul etc.


Apart from this there are 2 example files which will give you an idea
on how to use this library functionality.
